rpi-squeezedisplay
==================

A small tool to display squeezeslave [1] information (such as current playig title, artist, etc) on a SPI LCD display connected to a raspberry pi

As display I am using a BitWizard SPI LCD [2].
BitWizard also provides a tool for accessing the SPI expansion Board on the rpi. [3]

The information is optained by the Logitech Media Server CLI [4]
